# n8n-nodes-doppler-secrets

> [!NOTE]
> This version of the `n8n-nodes-doppler-secrets` n8n Community Node is my ([@qhse-professionals][0]) fork of [the original][1].
> Due to the sensitive nature of the data that this node handles, I have forked it to ensure that I can maintain it and keep it up to date with the latest version of n8n & Doppler. I have also added a few features that I need for my own workflows. It also fixes one issue which prevented me to use the original.

This is an n8n community node that lets you use [Doppler][2] for secret/variable management in your n8n workflows.
